          	<em>Oxfam: 70 Years of Advertising</em> showcases and celebrates the newly
			catalogued Oxfam Archive, which was kindly donated to the Bodleian
			Library by Oxfam GB in 2012 and is due to be fully accessible to
			researchers in 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to present the critical advertising and marketing schemes that have been
			developed through Oxfam’s rich 70 year history that have made Oxfam the recognisable
			charity we know today. We will demonstrate how novel and innovative advertising
			strategies have allowed Oxfam to flourish from a small group of concerned Oxonians into
			a globally recognised, international confederacy of 17 organizations fighting poverty
			and injustice in 94 countries.
          </p>
          <p>
	        The full Oxfam Archive Catalogue can be viewed at the Weston and is
            <a href="https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/our-work/projects/saving-oxford-medicine/cataloguing-the-oxfam-archive">accessible online</a>.
